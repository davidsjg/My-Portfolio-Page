# My-Portfolio-Page

My picture portfolio with responsive web design.

Title: Device-Responsiveness-Portfolio

Introduction: The goal of this website was to create a three page biography about myself all while maintaining device responsiveness integrity. Three specific pixel sizes - 992, 768, and 400 - were selected to be analyzed. Additionally, work with Bootstrap and it's grid system was utilized to build functioning, visually-appealing layouts. Containers, rows, and columns were all used to develop a layout similar to completed websites.

Technologies: Bootstrap

Launch: No data is required to launch this code. Site will function without access to pictures.

Scope of Functionalities: Website provides three separate webpages to build my biography. 'Index.html' is a page containing background information on me. 'Contact.html' is a page that allows the user to submit their name, email, and a message to me. 'Portfolio.html' is a page that displays my picture portfolio of high mountain lakes. All three of these pages can link to one-another via the navbar at the top. Clicking 'Joey Davidson' in the navbar will bring you back to 'Index.html'. Each webpage is designed for device-responsiveness, or site functionality regardless of viewport.

Problems Faced: Early problems dealt with linking Bootstrap into containers, and having the proper code pasted into the proper row/column while maintaining physical and device integrity. Adjusting column widths inside of column classes for multiple viewports was also a challenge. With containers, rows, and columns nested inside other containers, rows, and columns, the device-responsiveness had to be dialed in.

Potential Future Plans: More information about myself. Portfolio page to enlarge pictures on-click. Add videos and youtube links to fishing and hiking adventures.
